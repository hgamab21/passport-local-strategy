# Passport: Local Strategy

A basic example of using passport.js with sequelize and express to create a simple login with authentication using a Local Strategy.

### Background

As a TA for a web development course, students of mine wanted an example of a basic passport use-case. The problem I ran into, however, was that many of the examples that I saw were outdated and required updating - not very student-friendly. So i went about taking one of the examples and updating it for them to study and implement themselves.

### Features

*Input validation
*Local Strategy authentication

### Technologies

*Node
*MySQL (via Sequelize)
*Express
*Passport.js (http://www.passportjs.org/)

## Installation

Use the Node Package Manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) first to install all necessary dependencies.

```bash
npm i
```

NOTE: This also uses the module 'mysql2' as a dependency, you will need to install this as well after your inital install:

```bash
npm i mysql2
```
